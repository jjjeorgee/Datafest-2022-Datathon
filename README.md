## Abstract
The aim of this project is to train a Machine Learning model to help a Financial Industry predict who is likely to complete an E-process application.

## Machine Learning Model
### Using cross validation with LighthGBM

## Conclusions
After carrying out this exploratory data analysis, the following conclusions were made:

1. Most applicants fall within the age brackets of 41-50(3,575/28.58%) and 31-40(3,499/27.97%)
2. 1979 of all applicants who signed electronically are in the 31-40 age group, making it the highest occurring age group.
3. 6,766/54.06% of all applicants signed electronically.
4. Applicants requesting for higher amounts (>$1500) are less likely to sign electronically.
5. Applicants with higher incomes are less likely to sign electronically.
6. 4,059 (60%) of all applicants who signed electronically were not homeowners.
